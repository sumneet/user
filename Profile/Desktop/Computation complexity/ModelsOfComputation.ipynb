      "So far we have talked about Big-O notation and complexity classes (P, NP, etc) quite vaguely. We have said that an algorithm in P is one that can be computed in \"polynomial\" time (i.e. reasonably fast) by an abstract machine, but we have not said very much about what an abstract machine is or how it might work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why talk about algorithms in this way? Because we want to compare different algorithms, and *not* benchmark different implementations of the algorithms. We want to know whether one algorithm is inherently faster or more space efficient regardless of whether the algorithm is implemented on a machine which has a smaller or larger cache, smaller or larger memory, a faster or slower CPU and so on. We want to abstract all those details away, and leave only the fundamental steps of the algorithm itself - hence we need an *abstract machine*.\n",
      "\n",
      "The early history of Computer Science contains a lot of work on abstract machines. People were interested in ways to automate mathematics and they wanted to go beyond creating simple calculating machines and understand whether it would be possible to construct a machine that could make the sort of creative and intuitive leaps that a human can. For example, can a machine be built to play chess? Or prove any mathematical theorem? We now know (thanks to the work of people like Alan Turing and Kurt G\u00f6del) that computers can compute answers to most problems, but there are some classes of problems that cannot be solved automatically. More on that later...\n",

      "These models of computation are said to be *universal*. That means that all these different models of computation are in some way equivalent. So, if we can write a program in Lambda Calculus to solve a problem, we can also write a program for a Turing Machine to solve the same prooblem, and vice versa. Computer Scientists usually think of this in terms of *simulations*. We know that the Lambda Calculus is equivalent to Turing Machines because we can write a program in Lambda Calculus that simulates any Turing Machine (TM), and we can write a TM program to simulate a Lambda Calculus interpreter. This should make some sense to you, even though we haven't said much about what a TM or the Lambda Calculus is. You do know that the Lambda Calculus is like a programming language, and a TM is like a physical computer. You probably also know that anything you can design in a hardware circuit you can also write a program to compute. Equally, anything you can program in Java or Python you can design a circuit for. The equivalence between different models of computation is just like the equivalence between circuits and programs."

The tape may be infinitely long, so the TM can never run out of tape. In some explanations the tape has a start. Cells which have not been written to should be filled with the blank symbol.\n",
      "  - A head that can read and write symbols on the tape and move the tape left and right one cell at a time. You can think of the head as being like the moving head of a hard drive or the needle on a record player.\n",
      "  - A register that stores the current state of the TM. The TM has a special start state with which the state register is initialized. \n",
